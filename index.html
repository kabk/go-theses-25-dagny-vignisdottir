			<p>
				Through looking at shared origins of life on Earth and weaving human narratives with multispecies
				accounts, this thesis explores the fundamental interconnection between terrestrial beings and their
				life-sustaining planet. It examines humankind’s positioning within the natural world, its ontological
				connection, a cultural disconnection and its many visual representations. Critically addressing the
				commodification of nature and its role in an untimely ecological collapse, it reimagines alternative
				worlds built on reciprocity, care, and collective survival.

				In this story, we will be tracing the origins of life on Earth to its material beginnings and
				traveling down evolutionary routes, wading through entangled histories, skipping some parts and biting into
				others, weaving human narratives in with more-than-human accounts and seeing where they overlap,
				where they complement each other and when they don’t, where they diverge and when they were forced apart,
				what’s left behind, what to do, which steps to take, how to weave them in again.

			<h2 id="GENESIS"><i>GENESIS</i></h2>


			<sup id="img1" class="image-ref"></sup>
			<p>
				
				It’s most likely that you<sup id="ref1" class="footnote-ref">1</sup>
				would consider yourself as a member of the genus Homo Sapiens. If so, then you’d probably have some
				sort of a body, and a skeleton to hold it in place. Your body would contain living cells and
				extracellular materials, which would be organized into tissues, organs, and other systems, and amount to an
				impressively expansive organism. You’d probably have features which you’d use to sense the world;
				perhaps a tongue, some skin, a pair of ears and eyes,
				and an uncharacteristically large brain to make sense of it all. As a mammal, you’d presumably
				possess mammal-like qualities, such as hair & mammary glands (Lotha et al., 2000). Given that you are in
				fact human, you’re not all that different from earlier instances in the human lineage, and though
				complex, your bodily system is akin to many other organic lifeforms<sup id="ref2" class="footnote-ref">2</sup>
				(Rafferty et al., 1998). You share DNA with your fellow Earth-kin<sup id="ref3"
				class="footnote-ref">3</sup>, and some more than others. You share 99.9% of your DNA with
				another human, 98.8% with chimpanzees, 97.5% with mice, 94% with dogs, 80% with cows, 60% with
				a common fruit fly, and more than 50% with a banana
				(Ang, 2021).
			</p>

			<p>
				If you’d like to trace your genealogical history further, you would eventually find yourself on the
				ocean floor some 4.2 billion years ago, in a single-cell bacterial organism (or group of organisms)
				presently titled as LUCA, or the Last Universal Common Ancestor of all life on Earth<sup id="ref4"
				class="footnote-ref">4</sup> (Wade, 2016).
				It’s becoming was quite remarkable, as it was brought on by a series of ecological events caused by
				the impact of our moon colliding with Earth, which converted the surface of our planet into a bed of
				boiling lava, turned water to gasses, and carbon to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Only when Earth had cooled
				down significantly enough to contain liquid water–and said water interacted with magma erupting through
				the ocean floor–were the ideal conditions generated for LUCA, your ancestor<sup id="ref5"
				class="footnote-ref">5</sup>, to emerge. LUCA was not the origin of life on Earth, but rather the emergence of carbon-based life
				as we know it today[1]<sup id="ref6" class="footnote-ref">6</sup> (Fox, 2024).
			</p>

			<p>
				With the shifting conditions of the ecosystem and increased flow of energy and minerals, LUCA
				further evolved into different types of organisms: some plant-like and some animal-like: soft-bodied
				multicellular organisms with nervous systems, guts, muscle tissues, and traces of cholesterol
				(Mileham et al., n.d.). Just like you, they could move, feed, digest and reproduce. An increase in oxygen<sup
					id="ref7" class="footnote-ref">7</sup> led to their development of eyes & spines, and only
				when calcium, phosphate & other materials got added to<sup id="ref8" class="footnote-ref">8</sup>
				the primordial soup,<sup id="ref9" class="footnote-ref">9</sup> could they armor themselves with teeth, claws,
				shells & skeletons. Each time the conditions changed, they changed with them, and every iteration generated a new
				iteration (Fox, 2024). All these iterations shared (and share) a crucial dependence on the cyclical flow of
				energy and minerals, where our bodies capture a portion of this flow at birth, release it when we die and
				transform into different sets of materials. From plants to herbivores, to carnivores to plants
				again.<sup id="ref10" class="footnote-ref">10</sup> In many ways, the stability and resilience of
				ecosystems is rooted in this constant circulation of biomass and flesh (de Landa, 1997).

			<sup id="img2" class="image-ref"></sup>
			<p>	
				As fleshy lifeforms and biomasses ourselves, we too, partake in this type of energy exchange, which
				is often referred to as a food chain. There are many ways in which energy circulates through life-systems
				on Earth, and there are many types of food chains. When they overlap–and form a system of interlocking
				chains–we can call them “food webs”. The interaction between individual members of these organic
				systems, and with inorganic systems, is called an ecosystem. “Ecosystems are not random assemblages
				of species, but self-organized meshworks in which species are interconnected by their functional
				complementarities: prey and predator, host and parasite” (De Landa, 1997, p. 106). Since all
				lifeforms belong to some ecosystem, they’re practically everywhere<sup id="ref11" class="footnote-ref">11</sup>.
				There are rich ecosystems existing on your skin and whole societies in dust particles. This is
				cleverly demonstrated in Dr. Seuss’ fable <i>Horton hears a Who!</i> where Horton, the Elephant and protagonist of
				the story, finds a speck of dust and learns that it carries a whole biome<sup id="ref12"
					class="footnote-ref">12</sup> of its own[2] (Seuss, 1954). Inside these biomes and ecosystems, its agents<sup id="ref13"
					class="footnote-ref">13</sup> engage in intimate relationships with one another, which are called symbiotic relationships. When
				all species involved benefit from these interactions, we call them mutalistic relationships.<sup id="ref14"
					class="footnote-ref">14</sup> Wolves and ravens are a good example of this type of
				dynamic. In these mutualisms, the ravens alert the wolves if a prey is in sight, which the pack attacks, and the
				ravens get to feast on the leftovers (Bryden, 2023). Similarly, Yucca moths lay their eggs in the seedpods
				of yucca plants. The plant gets pollinated, and when the larvae hatch, they have a plant to snack on
				(Encyclopedia Britannica, 2025). There are many documented cases of human and more-than-human<sup
					id="ref15" class="footnote-ref">15</sup> mutualisms, such as humans collaborating with whales
				and dolphins in locating and hunting fish, where the sea-bound ones typically did most of the finding and got their
				share of the catch as compensation (Truscott, 2022); or the long-standing mutualist relationship
				between humans and cats.
			</p>

			<p>
				Though built environments, such as cities and towns, are by default excluding in the types of
				lifeforms and natures allowed to persist inside of them; and consequently lacking in variety of organic
				systems, they are still teeming with life in overlapping ecosystems, and every small weed that grows against
				the manufactured landscape contains a rich life of its own. The built environments can also be
				considered ecosystems themselves, both in relation to its human and more-than-human inhabitants, but also the
				biomass that circulates through them to sustain said inhabitants. Cities and towns engage in
				parasitic relationships with their rural surroundings, which they use to produce said biomass and other forms
				of energy (de Landa, 1977).
			</p>

			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;"> 11. <i>Ecosystems</i> vary in size: some are small enough to be contained within a single droplet of water,
				while others are large enough to encompass entire landscapes and regions (Encyclopedia Britannica,
				2025).</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;"> 12. A <i>biome</i> is the largest geographic biotic unit, a major community of plants and animals with
				similar
				life forms and environmental conditions (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2025).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;"> 13. An <i>agent</i> is a being with the capacity to act and make decisions. It’s anyone or anything with
				agency (or free will).</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;"> 14. A <i>parasitic relationship</i> is when one species benefits and the other one is harmed, and a
				<i>commensalist relationship</i> is when one side benefits and the other remains indifferent (Encyclopedia
				Britannica, 2025).</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;"> 15. Coined by ecologist and philosopher David Abram, <i>more-than-human</i> refers to the qualities or
				attributes found in nature which include but exceed those of human beings: for example, sentience,
				emotion, intelligence, purpose and agency. By using the words more-than, instead of other-than or
				non-, it challenges human-centric narratives when writing about more-than-humans (Abram, 1996).

				There are incredible amounts of diverse lifeforms currently existing in entanglement with one
				another on Earth. More than two million existing species have been named and described and many remain to be
				discovered<sup id="ref16" class="footnote-ref">16</sup>. These organisms are also as varied as they
				are many: on Earth you can see bacteria living in hot springs, fungi thriving on ice masses, algae in saline
				waters, spiders on top of the Himalayas, and giant tube worms in hydrothermal vents on the ocean
				floor (Ayla, 2025). On both collective and individual levels, these lifeforms physically embody their
				evolutionary heritage, not only in their DNA and their structure but also the very materials they’re
				made of. Life on Earth is still assembled from the same recycled materials as it started with: some
				carbon, some calcium, phosphate, and other materials (de Landa, 1977). That being said, their
				structure<sup id="ref17" class="footnote-ref">17</sup> is maybe
				even more interesting to look at, as it’s quite the peculiar phenomenon: The way in which these
				bio-materials flow, grow, and physically manifest themselves has a habitual tendency to follow the
				same type of formula:<sup id="ref18" class="footnote-ref">18</sup> 
				a single line that splits, which splits again and again and again. It’s nature’s most efficient
				route for growth and distribution of energy: a mathematical formula called fractals<sup id="ref19"

				These self-similar branching patterns can be found everywhere: You can notice them in flowers, trees
				& plants, in Earthly weather systems and the cosmos, in mountains, rivers, waves and coastlines
				(ibid.). You can also see them in the structure of your body: in your veins, your skin, your lungs & kidneys,
				your brain, nervous system, and in the rhythms of your heart; in your microbes and molecular
				structure, and in the arrangement of your DNA. The branching pattern that divides the deltas is the same as the
				subdivision of your veins; the neural networks in your brain look just like stars in galaxies; and
				your lungs are like a branching tree, whose cross-section resembles your fingerprint.
				You can recognize these shared geometries in your fellow homo sapiens, your fellow mammals, fellow
				lifeforms and all other organic systems that surround you (Neronha et al., 2019). As relatives,
				we’re interconnected and intertwined–and if you look closely, you can see yourself in the other & every
				living thing in every living thing[3]. You might even come to the conclusion that not only do you
				resemble nature, but you might in fact <i>be</i> nature.

			<br>
			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;">18. <i>Fractals</i> are one of many universal formulas that guide the structure of our universe, along with

			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;">19. Though many have observed and described the fractal phenomena, fractals were officially
				discovered by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who described them in his scientific casebook or manifesto,
				titled The Fractal Geometry of Nature. “I coined fractal from the Latin adjective fractus. The
				corresponding Latin verb frangere means “to break:” to create irregular fragments. It is therefore sensible—and
				how appropriate for our needs!—that, in addition to “fragmented” (as in fraction or refraction), fractus
				should also mean “irregular,” both meanings being preserved in fragment” (Mandelbrot, 1977).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;">20. The first description of a fractal pattern in nature might have come from the Renaissance artist
				and scientist Leonardo da Vinci, who noted that “All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height

			<p>
			
				As at least an agent of nature,<sup id="ref21" class="footnote-ref">21</sup> you have been through
				millions of years of evolution and taken part in
				countless cycles of flows of energy & minerals (de Landa, 1977). In a single lifetime, you likely
				participate in certain rituals or life practices that have proven to sustain you<sup id="ref22"
					class="footnote-ref">22</sup> and your cells until your timely demise and the next cycle begins:
				You
				try to mind your water
				intake, you scavenge for nutrients that would sustain you , you might rest in some kind of a nest or
				shelter, and you might engage in courtship rituals. The bearded vulture, for instance, uses
				cosmetics to
				enhance his status within his society. He rubs red clay into his feathers to signify to his
				prospective
				partners that he simply must be a great hunter since he has all this time for makeup (OConnell,
				2014).
				Similarly, the white-spotted pufferfish spends ages creating intricate sand decorations on the
				bottom of
				the ocean in hopes of attracting a mate that would appreciate his craftsmanship (Safi, 2023). There
				are
				plenty of animals that engage in similar rituals and many who lean into the art of decorating one’s
				spaces, e.g. through collecting precious materials. Crows, ravens and bower birds are all devoted
				collectors (Lotzof, n.d.).
			</p>


			<p>

				Decorating our habitats is often a way to signify to others a certain status or agenda. You can see
				a
				clear example of this by looking at religious monuments in human societies: which are often
				plastered
				with all sorts of signage and symbols to broadcast and emphazise their religious dogmas (Jason,
				2025).
				When looking at other sites, such as achitecture in built societies of the Global North,<sup id="ref23"
					class="footnote-ref">23</sup> we can see more ways in which status is promoted. In
				recent history,
				wealth is often expressed through the size and location of a building, and quality of materials
				used.
				Before the onset and effects of Modernism, it was often expressed through craftsmanship and
				complexity
				of the construction, and often times through décor and ornamentation.
				A common motif was nature; either as direct representations of a natural subject or more indirectly
				so;
				as shapes and constructions following the signature branching patterns of nature. Ornate ironwork
				can look like branching trees or twisting vines, and rose windows in churches[5] often resemble the
				structure of sea urchins[6] or the insides of flowers. They also look like the sand-art of the pufferfish[4], which
				could itself be a rendering of a leaf or a halved kiwi.

				It‘s worth noting the irony of post-embedding imitations of nature into built environments:
				Stripping the natural landscape of its organic materials and using them to build said environments, only to
				reincorporate them as natural motifs in ornamentation... Perhaps the popularity in the use of the
				natural motif was in some way an effort to replace the nature that was lost, maybe in some sort of
				ancestral self-remembrance<sup id="ref24" class="footnote-ref">24</sup>, or maybe because they
				simply found it beautiful. It certainly evokes a lot of questions. If it was because they found it beautiful, is it because it
				depicts nature and we find natural elements beautiful? And if we find natural elements beautiful, is
				it because we resonate with them? And is that because we see ourselves in it? If we are nature, do
				depictions of nature count as self-portraiture?
			</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully, there’s been substantial research done on environmental psychology and neuroscience in
				the
				last years, and some of its findings could potentially shed light on our inquiries. Scientists have
				studied human perception of fractals and made the link between our evolving in a rugged, bumpy and
				fractal landscape, to an inherent and familiar appreciation of the fractal form or formulas<sup
					id="ref25" class="footnote-ref">25</sup>
				(Austigard, 2023). When applying this to the designed landscape, they also found that people’s
				pleasure
				in looking at built environments correlates with increased complexity of silhouettes of objects and
				buildings. Increased complexity also aids in our wayfinding and processing of these landscapes,
				since
				detailed and diverse environments help us better understand and navigate through them (Stamps,
				1999).
				Humans have also proven to be preferential towards symmetrical and repetitive forms, which are
				characteristic across organic subjects and natural environments (Robles et al., 2020).

				everywhere. From molecules to planetary systems. The fractal dimension that generates the most
				pleasure in people is between 1.3 and 1.5 (D=1.3-1.5), which is not a big surprise, because we are, through
				evolution, adapted to functioning well in this environment. It’s only natural that this is what we

			<h2 id="The OTHERING of NATURE"><i>The OTHERING of NATURE</i></h2>
			<p>
				For most of our history, humans (more or less) saw the natural world as a vibrant organism, where
				the
				human was only one aspect of the organism’s overall functioning, and engaged in non-hierarchical
				relations with other members of the group.<sup id="ref26" class="footnote-ref">26</sup> Rapid
				acceleration in
				sciences in Western Europe in the midle of the previous millenium caused a profound (and lasting)
				shift
				in how we view and situate ourselves within the natural world. During the Enlightenment and with the
				Scientific Revolution, the organism had become more like a machine, with parts to be taken apart and
				studied<sup id="ref27" class="footnote-ref">27</sup> (Pierre
				et al., 2019), while the active landscape got demoted to a background of human activities (Tsing,
				2015).
				This proved to be the beginning of our (conceived) separation from nature. “Perhaps this was an
				inevitable outcome: By seeing the natural world as something to be held at arm’s length and studied
				objectively, we removed ourselves from our own picture of nature” (Kosinski, 2020). We no longer saw
				ourselves within an unbounded and uncontrollable cosmos, the complex and mysterious, magically
				enchanted
				and larger-than-human organic world, but rather as governors of a quantifiable, controllable,
				exploitable and commodifiable resource. As Earth-centered values were replaced with humanistic ones,
				the Western human man was put on the very top of the hierarchy. Phenomena deemed opaque or irrational
				were increasingly devalued in this new rationalist world; such as the natural, the spiritual, the
				emotional, and the female. Some argue that this is when Modernity began (Pierre et al., 2019) and even some
				that this marked a new chapter in our geological history (Demos, 2017).<sup id="ref28" class="footnote-ref">28</sup>
			</p>

				In the first chapter, we briefly mentioned the parasitic relationship between built societies and
				their rural surroundings, which they use to supply their energy and sustenance. This relationship creates
				a power imbalance between its members, where the agents of said rural surroundings become the
				provider; and in the built society, the consumer (de Landa, 1977). Who gets to play which role is determined
				by colonialist and imperialist forces–inspired by humanistic values inherited from the Scientific
				Revolution–which decide what parts of the landscape should be considered resources, and what parts
				can be inhabited. These systems usually and unfortunately, place the Global North at the top of the
				hierarchy while the Global South<sup id="ref29" class="footnote-ref">29</sup>
				operates as their fuel system. More often than not, this leads to ruthless and exploitative
				extractive practices of these landscapes and their inhabitants, which results in forced labor and ecological
				catastrophes.<sup id="ref30" class="footnote-ref">30</sup> However, these practices are far from
				localized in the Global South only (Pierre et al., 2019).

			<p>
				
				Today, a huge portion of Earth’s natural landscapes has been turned into a resource[7]. Humans manage
				three quarters of all land outside the ice sheets, and almost half of our planet’s habitable land is used
				for agriculture (Globaïa, 2009). The claiming, clearing, and cultivation of these lands in the pursuit
				of profit, have created enormous devastation on an unimaginable scale, both for the lifeforms involved,
				and the ecosystems that encompass and sustain them. The catastrophic impacts are almost countless: we’re
				currently experiencing rising temperatures, melting ice caps, thawing permafrost, and ocean
				acidification (Edwards, Graulund & Höglund, 2022). It’s also
				“extraordinary burdens of toxic chemistry, mining, nuclear pollution, depletion of lakes and rivers
				under and above ground, ecosystem simplification, vast genocides of people and other critters,[…]
				in systemically linked patterns that threaten major system collapse after major system collapse
				after major system collapse” 

				(Haraway, 2016, p. 100).
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only have forces of human existence altered Earth’s cycles (Globaïa, 2009), but also overwhelmed
				all other biological, geological, and meteorological forms and forces and became the determinate form of
				our planetary existence. Many would like to label this event the controversial Anthropocene–or the age
				of the New Human (Povinelli, 2017).<sup id="ref31" class="footnote-ref">31</sup>
				This terminology, though initially seeming fitting for the circumstance, has
				since been a matter of heated debate among scientists & researchers (Zhong, 2024), as it pins blame on all
				humans which is neither fair nor true–and frankly, kind of a cop-out for the true powers at hand.
				Writer TJ Demos, in his book Against the Anthropocene, dismisses this term as asymmetric and
				inherently wrong (Demos, 2017).
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s imperative to mention that the most dominant force in all this destruction have without a doubt
				been the forces of corporate industry, which not-so-coincidentally have most to lose if we’d head
				for a more environmentally friendly route of planetary existence. Here, Demos points towards indigenous
				practices and states that the corporate facilitators of planetary destruction shift blame towards
				the individual. In fact, the corporate and financial elites and growth-obsessed leaders of the
				petrocapitalist industry do everything in their power to keep humans on the same path, by using
				their financial and media resources to “manipulate governments through corporate lobbying<sup
				id="ref32" class="footnote-ref">32</sup> remove sustainable energy options from even entering the discussion, fund climate change deniers,
				and advocate for continued large-scale and extreme fossil fuel extraction” (Demos, 2017, p. 29).
				Because of this, many prefer the more appropriate name Capitalocene;<sup id="ref33"
				class="footnote-ref">33</sup> as it exposes the culprit in its name and highlights the “economic determination of our geological
				present” (Demos, 2017, p. 55). Many more terms have been used to describe this period, which all say too much
				and too little at the same time. I propose a sort of amalgamation of the two we’ve already mentioned:
				“the AnthropoCapitalocene”, a handy term which simultaneously opens up, and names and blames
				in all the right places.<sup id="img8" class="image-ref"></sup>

			<p>
				Nature’s revised definition as a machine quickly spread to other levels of Western human existence,
				and while the landscape became a resource, humans got commodified as workers. The Industrial
				Revolution<sup id="ref34" class="footnote-ref">34</sup>
				produced many mechanisms and phenomena that sped up the machine’s production while lowering costs,
				such as factories, assembly lines,<sup id="ref35" class="footnote-ref">35</sup> and mass production. For
				the first time, factories rendered humans capable of existing independently outside of their farmlands (and
				comparable ecosystems). Even though the work was both hazardous and incredibly monotonous for the workers, it
				generated immense profits for the factory owners, who prioritized production and profit over all
				else.
				Their management of the workers’ labour was rooted in efficiency, utility and optimization;<sup
					id="ref36" class="footnote-ref">36</sup> and both introduced & solidified the human-work relationship we experience today. Not to mention
				the incredibly destructive impact the industrialization had on Earth’s systems, which many tie to the
				beginning of the AnthropoCapitalocene. While mass production of goods made them more accessible and
				affordable, they became standardized and subsequently simplified[8] (Rafferty, 2017). In many ways, the
				utilization and standardization of the West stripped the landscape of its superficial layers and
				revealed a sterile, homogenous terrain, critically lacking in diversity, in all senses of the word.
			</p>

			<p>
				<sup id="img9" class="image-ref"></sup>
				Naturally, the accelerating destruction and alteration, automattion, standardization, monetization,
				rationalization & utilization of Earth in the last 300 or so years, has led to many cycles of
				opposition. It’s also been the root cause behind an ongoing conversation in art and design fields. A
				hundred years into the effects of the Industrial Revolution, we saw the Arts & Crafts movement in
				Great Britain (and North America); a direct response to the industrialization of Europe, which advocated
				for a return to nature<sup id="ref37" class="footnote-ref">37</sup>
				and traditional craftsmanship in rejection to mass production. Shortly after, it was Art Nouveau in Belgium[9] and
				France, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezessionstil in Austria, Stile Floreale/Liberty in Italy, and many other representations. 
				
				In one way or another, these movements promoted nature and the natural form, which they used for inspiration, and as a guide or grid system<sup id="ref38"
					class="footnote-ref">38</sup> in their various creations. Their vision was
				translated into ornamental forms across medias, which helped the jagged, organic line we love and
				adore,
				flow seamlessly from nature into built society, and bridge the gap between the organic- & strikingly
				mechanical landscapes. Modernism emerged as a reaction against these movements<sup id="ref39"
					class="footnote-ref">39</sup>, and sought to unify the landscape through subtraction and
				simplification. The rugged, flowing line flattened out, and the grid became rigid, straight and
				synthetic. Natural references were exiled under utilitarian Modernism, and ornaments and other
				decorative parts were served cease-and-desist<sup id="ref40" class="footnote-ref">40</sup>
				orders (Pierre et al., 2019). And while wildflowers got mowed from monoculture landscapes & species
				found themselves in a mass extinction (Morton, 2021), it’s almost like they were never there.

				Of course, this is only a small fraction of the vast discourse on the past, present and futures of
				terrestrial beings and systems in the AnthroCapitalocene, and many have taken far more radical
				measures in promoting nature and advocating for environmental action. In recent years, we’ve witnessed
				large-scale climate activism, such as the global <i>Fridays for Future</i> school strikes initiated by

			<p>
				Little by little, the conversations we have about the world end up amounting to the world itself. We
				create it by speaking it into existence, and through it, decide who is and is not part of the story.
				Author Ursula K. Le Guin famously describes this story-making and history-making<sup id="ref43" class="footnote-ref">43</sup> 
				as an accumulative process of gathering stories in bags–which, throughout human history, has proved
				preferential to hu-man<sup id="ref44" class="footnote-ref">44</sup> centric, western-centric, heroic and 
				action-packed narratives, over accounts of delicate care and
				companionship, motherhood and many layered complexities of Earthly existence (Le Guin, 1986).

				Other stories become just other stories when they get reduced to supporting acts for the hero.
				Ironically, the hero in our Anthropocene-story is not humanity and not even hu-man, but a tiny

				One way of telling the story of the AnthropoCapitalocene would be of a heroic battle between hu-man
				and
				nature, where man won the war and harnessed the powers of nature to use in his divine quest for
				redemption. It’s also a story of an indigenous person whose home got swallowed by petro-chemical
				infrastructures, displacing her whole community and permanently destroying her health<sup id="ref45"
					class="footnote-ref">45</sup>
				(Demos, 2017). Earthlings in some subtropical grasslands might know it as the event where everything
				they thought they knew about their section of the world got turned on its head and collapsed
				(Rosane, 2020). For more than two million species it’s probably nothing short of Armageddon, but since
				they’re now extinct they can’t really share their stories (Odenthal & Suner, n.d.). Of course, there’s too
				many stories to possibly condense into a singular narrative, and that’s exactly the point. We have to
				allow more stories and more points of views to enter the discussion, not only human but, and especially,
				all terrestrial species.<sup id="ref46" class="footnote-ref">46</sup> And we must reject the hu-man
				exceptionalist-,
				anthropomorphic<sup id="ref47" class="footnote-ref">47</sup> and anthropocentric<sup id="ref48"
					class="footnote-ref">48</sup> point of
				view, if we want to keep on telling the story. “A common livable world must be composed, bit by bit,
				or not at all” (Latour, 2010, p. 473).
			</p>
			<p>
				Like in Dr. Seuss’ fable, we must use our agency to give voice to the other and speak worlds beyond
				ours into collective existence. Seuss’ story–though fictional and totally anthropomorphic–represents
				a type of alternative storytelling,<sup id="ref49" class="footnote-ref">49</sup> which is another
				thing we absolutely must do. We must tell more stories; fictional, autobiographical, scientific, pretend and
				make-believe, critical and speculative, mediocre and fantastical stories; through writing, painting, film- and
				music-making, note-taking, speaking into existence and scribbling on a wall; stories of what was and
				will be, what could be, what shouldn’t be, what is and is not. This is how we create the world, and
				also how we change it. Regardless of their nature, regular-human stories are still
				terrestrial-being-stories, world-making and world-changing stories.

			<p class="intext-margin-note" style="display: none;">46. Anthropologist and philosopher Bruno Latour calls these stories <i>Earth stories, Gaïa stories</i> or

				Semiotics play a huge role in storytelling. Either I did something, or you did something, or maybe

				are to protect and care for them<sup id="ref52" class="footnote-ref">52</sup> (Hamilton, 1964). I can’t help but wonder

				For Donna Haraway, this is how we “make kin” with one another. By embracing the relations between us

				stands for relations with–often as family or chosen family. So, when we refer to our family of human

				family members, we can call them Earth-kin/Earthkin, since all of us Earthlings are kin in the deepest
				sense of the word<sup id="ref54" class="footnote-ref">54</sup>
				And by considering the multiplicity of us entangled Earthlings, we engage in tentacular thinking

				At the end of the hero-story in the action-movie, the daring protagonist blows up the building with
				the bad guys in it and flees the scorched-Earth remnants of the planet in his Ark or spaceship, to
				someplace where the grass is greener, with his dear ones aboard, and to hell with all that’s left behind, if
				it doesn’t contribute to his story. But his imagined elsewhere is only a mirage, and no one told him
				that escapist fantasies make futile exit strategies, and that he’s rendered useless without Earth’s soil
				and place within its cyclical life-sustaining systems. And so, as it tends to, the life-story carries on
				in his absence; weaving tales about tube worms in hydrothermal vents on ocean floors, spiders on
				mountains, and natures breaking through cement landscapes. He should’ve known that every end of a successful
				hero’s journey requires a return to origins, reconciliation and mourning, reparation and renewal. The
				continuation of his story depends on weaving it in with and acknowledging it as part of the original
				story, the life-story, the entangled multi-species story of life on his home planet. Only from this
				recognition can he move forward, not as a glorious victor but a humble participant in a shared,
				intertwined world. The grass on his side is already green enough, he just needs to water it ⚘

			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note4">
				4. Earth is 4.5 billion years old.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note5">
				5. LUCA’s descendants can be grouped into two domains of cellular life: prokaryotes (simply celled
				organisms like bacteria & archaea) & eukaryotes (all forms of complex multicellular life) (Lambert,
				2024).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note6">
				6. All known life on Earth is carbon-based, including you (Fortey, 2025).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note7">
				7. Referring to the oxygen levels in the ocean.

			<p class="margin-note" id="note8">
				8. More like washed into the soup, due to a major rise in sea level, which brought life-sustaining
				materials from land to sea (Fox, 2024).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note9">
				9. The <i>primordial soup</i> (also known as <i>prebiotic soup</i> or <i>primitive broth</i>) is a “generic term that
				describes the aqueous solution of organic compounds that accumulated in primitive water bodies of
				the
				early Earth as a result of endogenous abiotic syntheses and the extraterrestrial delivery by
				cometary
				and meteoritic collisions, and from which some have assumed that the first living systems evolved”
				(Bada
				& Lazcano, 2002).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note10">
				10. And <i>fungi</i>, of course.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note11">
				11. <i>Ecosystems</i> vary in size: some are small enough to be contained within a single droplet of water,
				while others are large enough to encompass entire landscapes and regions (Encyclopedia Britannica,
				2025).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note12">
				12. A <i>biome</i> is the largest geographic biotic unit, a major community of plants and animals with
				similar
				life forms and environmental conditions (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2025).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note13">
				13. An <i>agent</i> is a being with the capacity to act and make decisions. It’s anyone or anything with
				agency
				(or free will).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note14">
				14. A <i>parasitic relationship</i> is when one species benefits and the other one is harmed, and a
				<i>commensalist relationship</i> is when one side benefits and the other remains indifferent (Encyclopedia
				Britannica, 2025).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note15">
				15. Coined by ecologist and philosopher David Abram, <i>more-than-human</i> refers to the qualities or
				attributes found in nature which include but exceed those of human beings: for example, sentience,
				emotion, intelligence, purpose and agency. By using the words more-than, instead of other-than or
				non-, it challenges human-centric narratives when writing about more-than-humans (Abram, 1996).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note16">
				16. Currently estimated at around ten to thirty million species (Ayla, 2025).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note17">
				17. Or <i>our</i> structure.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note18">
				18. <i>Fractals</i> are one of many universal formulas that guide the structure of our universe, along with
				the <i>Fibonacci sequence</i>, the <i>Golden Ratio</i>, <i>Pi</i> (π), <i>Euler’s Number</i> (e), and more (Patra, 2018).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note19">
				19. Though many have observed and described the fractal phenomena, fractals were officially
				discovered
				by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who described them in his scientific casebook or manifesto,
				titled
				The Fractal Geometry of Nature. “I coined fractal from the Latin adjective fractus. The
				corresponding
				Latin verb frangere means “to break:” to create irregular fragments. It is therefore sensible—and
				how
				appropriate for our needs!—that, in addition to “fragmented” (as in fraction or refraction), fractus
				should also mean “irregular,” both meanings being preserved in fragment” (Mandelbrot, 1977).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note20">
				20. The first description of a fractal pattern in nature might have come from the Renaissance artist
				and scientist Leonardo da Vinci, who noted that “All the branches of a tree at every stage of its height
				when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk [below them]” (Hennings & Lynch, 2024).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note21">
				21. As a human, as a lifeform.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note22">
				22. Often found in grocery stores these days.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note23">
				23. The <i>Global North</i> is a term used to describe the industrialized nations in the northern
				hemisphere, which are often times the overall benefactors of global capitalism.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note24">
				24. Referring to humans living in richer natural ecosystems.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note25">
				25. “There’s a surprising tendecy towards fractals being in the range of 1.3 to 1.5 (D=1.3-1.5),
				everywhere. From molecules to planetary systems. The fractal dimension that generates the most
				pleasure in people is between 1.3 and 1.5 (D=1.3-1.5), which is not a big surprise, because we are, through
				evolution, adapted to functioning well in this environment. It’s only natural that this is what we
				find beautiful” (Austigard, 2023).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note26">
				26. Apart from natural pecking orders like prey/predator relationships.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note27">
				27. By doing so, scholars and scientists believed they could fully decode the workings of the
				natural world (Kosinski, 2020).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note28">
				28. Many scientists argue that the human induced changes to Earth’s geological systems are enough to
				consider it a geological epoch (Demos, 2017).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note29">
				29. <i>The Global South</i> is a term used to describe less industrialized nations in the southern
				hemisphere, which are often times the victims of global capitalism.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note30">
				30. Donna Haraway describes this event as the <i>Plantation-o-cene</i>, or <i>Plantationocene</i> (Haraway, 2016).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note31">
				31. Coined by biologist Eugene Stoermer and popularized by chemist Paul Crutzen in 2000. <i>Anthropo-</i>,
				a prefix meaning human, humanoid, or human-like, and <i>-cene</i> as being new (Demos, 2017).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note32">
				32. “Total oil and gas lobby spending in 2015 in the United States was an astounding $129,876,004,
				which breaks down into the figure of $355,825 per day, a financial driver that makes sure that renewable
				energy is kept off the table and safely away from consumers” (Demos, 2017).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note33">
				33. Initiated by author and ecologist Andreas Malm and widely used by scholars, scientists &
				eco-researchers like Donna Haraway, Jason Moore, T. J. Demos, and others in recent years.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note34">
				34. The Industrial Revolution originated in Great Britain and lasted from 1760 to around 1830.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note35">
				35. Industrialist Henry Ford invented the moving assembly line, and revolutionized factory
				production forever. However, the line was seen as an insult to skilled craftsmen, and “another example of the
				overwhelming patriarchal control a company could have over its workers in the age of mass
				production” (Eschner, 2016).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note36">
				36. Engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor was a pioneer in production-optimization-strategies and
				developed Taylorism, a popular method of industrial management designed to increase efficiency and
				productivity, where workflows and work processes are examined and optimized to reduce costs and increase quality
				(Munich Business School, n.d.).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note37">
				37. See: William Morris’ art and fiction writing, which envisions a world where humans are
				integrated with all of nature.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note38">
				38. <i>A grid system</i> is a visual guide that is used to organize and align elements within a design.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note39">
				39. And as a reaction to the World Wars and accelerating industrialization.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note40">
				40. Modernist architect Adolf Loos famously exiled ornaments and decoration with his manifesto
				Ornament and Crime in 1908, whose radical ideas significantly influenced the development of modernist visual
				landscapes.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note41">
				41. In 2019 in Ecuador, the Waorani people of Pastaza won a historic ruling in Ecuadorian court,
				protecting half a million acres of their territory in the Amazon rainforest from being earmarked for
				oil drilling (Amazon Frontlines, 2019).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note42">
				42. Extinction Rebellion says this on their website: “This is an Emergency. Our climate is changing
				faster than we predicted, and those in power have failed to act. Extinction Rebellion is demanding
				fair and transparent change, to ensure the future of all life on Earth” (Extinction Rebellion, n.d.).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note43">
				43. Or his-story-making?
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note44">
				44. I propose a distinction between human and <i>hu-man:</i> where the former refers to any individual of
				the human species, while the latter represents a Western, male-centric and idealized reproduction of a
				hu-man individual.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note45">
				45. “The situation of environmental injustice is similar elsewhere: like the Athabasca Chipewyan,
				minority and low income communities living on the edges of the massive petro-chemical infrastructure
				in Houston suffer greatly elevated risks of contracting leukemia and cancers owing to exposure to oil
				industry pollution” (Demos, 2017, pp. 28-29).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note46">
				46. Anthropologist and philosopher Bruno Latour calls these stories <i>Earth stories, Gaïa stories</i> or
				<i>geostories</i>: where all formerly passive agents of nature become active, as part of the story
				(Haraway, 2016).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note47">
				47. A phenomena is <i>anthropomorphic</i> when it has a human form or human attributes.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note48">
				48. <i>Anthropocentric</i> means human-centric and refers to the view of humans being the central, most
				important element of existence.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note49">
				49. “Alternative Narratives encompass a spectrum of voices, experiences, and viewpoints that diverge
				from dominant narratives prevalent in society” (The Oxford Review, n.d.).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note50">
				50. As the reader and the writer.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note51">
				51. As humans.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note52">
				52. And perceived closeness surpasses genealogical relations.
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note53">
				53. Dr. Cameron to Dr. Foreman in tv series House (S4ep06).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note54">
				54. “All critters share a common “flesh,” laterally, semiotically, and genealogically” (Haraway,
				2016, 103).
			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note55">
				55. “Tentacularity is about the myriad of entangled ways of being.” (Haraway, 2016, 32). Her
				<i>“tentacular-ity”</i> is inspired by tentacled creatures like octopuses and spiders, which weave
				intricate, networked relationships rather than following linear, human-centric modes of thinking. Tentacular
				thinking is the opposite of rigid, individualistic, and anthropocentric worldviews. At it’s core,
				tentacular thinking is non-anthropocentic ecological thinking.

			</p>
			<p class="margin-note" id="note56">
				56. Not to be confused with HP Lovecraft’s “Call of Cthulhu”, although linked through the notion of
				evoking something tentacular and beyond human control. Haraway’s “Cthulu” is derived from
				“chthonic”, meaning “of the earth” or “underworld,” referring to deep, ancient, and earthly forces (Haraway,
				2016).
